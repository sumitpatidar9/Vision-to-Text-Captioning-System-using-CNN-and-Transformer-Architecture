# Image Captioning with CNN and Transformer

This project implements an image captioning system that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer architectures to generate descriptive captions for images. The system uses the Flickr8k dataset, which contains images paired with human-annotated captions. The CNN extracts meaningful visual features from images, while the Transformer leverages these features to generate coherent and contextually relevant captions. The project demonstrates how to bridge computer vision and natural language processing to create an end-to-end model capable of describing images in natural language.

Below, we provide a high-level overview of the project workflow, followed by a detailed description of the model architecture and the simplified mathematical concepts that drive its functionality. The focus is on the high-level workings of the model, avoiding specific implementation details, results, or training parameters like epochs.

## Project Overview in Steps

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Load the Flickr8k dataset, which includes images and their corresponding captions.
   - Preprocess images by resizing them to a standard size (e.g., 224x224 pixels) and normalizing pixel values for compatibility with the CNN.
   - Preprocess captions by tokenizing text, building a vocabulary, and padding sequences to a uniform length for input to the Transformer.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Use a pre-trained CNN (e.g., VGG16) to extract high-level visual features from images.
   - Remove the final classification layer of the CNN to obtain a dense feature vector representing each image.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Construct a Transformer-based model that takes the CNN-extracted image features and generates captions.
   - The model includes an embedding layer for tokenized words, positional encodings for sequence order, and Transformer decoder layers for generating text.

4. **Loss and Optimization Setup**:
   - Define a loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy) to measure the difference between predicted and actual captions.
   - Set up an optimizer to adjust model weights during training to minimize the loss.

5. **Training Process**:
   - Train the model by feeding image features and partial captions, predicting the next word in the sequence iteratively.
   - Update the model weights to improve caption accuracy and coherence.

6. **Caption Generation**:
   - Generate captions for new images by passing their extracted features through the trained Transformer model.
   - Use a decoding strategy (e.g., greedy search or beam search) to construct the caption word by word.

7. **Evaluation Considerations**:
   - Qualitatively assess generated captions by inspecting their relevance and fluency.
   - Quantitatively evaluate performance using metrics like BLEU to compare generated captions against reference captions.

## Model Architecture

### CNN Feature Extractor (VGG16)
The CNN component extracts visual features from input images using a pre-trained VGG16 model, modified to output feature vectors instead of class probabilities.

- **Input**: RGB image (224x224x3).
- **Block 1**:
  - Two Conv2D layers (64 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation) → Output: 224x224x64.
  - MaxPooling2D (stride 2) → Output: 112x112x64.
- **Block 2**:
  - Two Conv2D layers (128 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation) → Output: 112x112x128.
  - MaxPooling2D (stride 2) → Output: 56x56x128.
- **Block 3**:
  - Three Conv2D layers (256 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation) → Output: 56x56x256.
  - MaxPooling2D (stride 2) → Output: 28x28x256.
- **Block 4**:
  - Three Conv2D layers (512 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation) → Output: 28x28x512.
  - MaxPooling2D (stride 2) → Output: 14x14x512.
- **Block 5**:
  - Three Conv2D layers (512 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation) → Output: 14x14x512.
  - MaxPooling2D (stride 2) → Output: 7x7x512.
- **Flatten and Dense**:
  - Flatten → Output: 25088-dimensional vector.
  - Dense layer (4096 units, ReLU activation) → Output: 4096-dimensional feature vector.
- **Output**: A 4096-dimensional feature vector representing the image.

### Transformer Decoder
The Transformer processes the CNN features and generates captions using a sequence-to-sequence approach.

- **Input**:
  - Image features (4096-dimensional vector).
  - Tokenized caption sequence (variable length, padded to a fixed length, e.g., max_length).
- **Embedding Layer**:
  - Converts input tokens to dense vectors (e.g., 256-dimensional).
- **Positional Encoding**:
  - Adds information about word positions in the sequence to preserve order.
- **Transformer Decoder Layers** (stacked, e.g., 1 or more layers):
  - **Multi-Head Attention**:
    - Performs self-attention on the caption sequence to capture relationships between words.
    - Attends to the image features to incorporate visual context.
  - **Layer Normalization**: Stabilizes and normalizes activations after attention.
  - **Feed-Forward Network**: Applies a dense layer with ReLU activation to each token position.
  - **Dropout**: Regularizes the model to prevent overfitting.
- **Dense Output Layer**:
  - Maps the final decoder output to the vocabulary size, with a softmax activation to predict the probability of each word.
- **Output**: A sequence of word probabilities, used to generate the next word in the caption.

### Overall Model
- The CNN feature extractor processes the image to produce a fixed-length feature vector.
- The Transformer decoder takes this feature vector and a partial caption, predicting the next word iteratively until a complete caption is formed or a maximum length is reached.

## Math Behind the Model (Simplified)

### CNN Feature Extraction
The CNN transforms an image into a feature vector through a series of convolutions, activations, and pooling operations:
- **Convolution**: Applies filters to detect patterns (e.g., edges, textures) in the image. For a pixel region, it computes: Output = sum(input * filter) + bias, followed by ReLU (max(0, x)).
- **Pooling**: Reduces spatial dimensions by taking the maximum value in a region (e.g., 2x2 window), preserving important features while shrinking the output size.
- **Dense Layer**: Combines all features into a single vector: Output = weights * input + bias, with ReLU activation.

The result is a high-dimensional vector summarizing the image’s content.

### Transformer Decoder
The Transformer generates captions using attention mechanisms and feed-forward networks:
- **Embedding**: Maps each word to a vector: Embedding(word) = vector of fixed size (e.g., 256).
- **Positional Encoding**: Adds a fixed vector to each word’s embedding based on its position in the sequence, ensuring the model knows the word order.
- **Self-Attention**:
  - For each word, computes attention scores to weigh the importance of other words in the sequence.
  - Simplified: Score = dot_product(query, key), where query and key are derived from word embeddings. The output is a weighted sum of value vectors.
- **Cross-Attention**:
  - Relates the caption sequence to the image features, allowing the model to focus on relevant visual information.
  - Similar to self-attention but uses image features as keys and values.
- **Feed-Forward**: Applies a linear transformation to each token: Output = weights * input + bias, followed by ReLU.
- **Loss**: Uses categorical cross-entropy to compare predicted word probabilities with actual words: Loss = -sum(actual_word * log(predicted_prob)) over the vocabulary for each word in the sequence.

During generation, the model predicts one word at a time, sampling from the softmax output (e.g., picking the most likely word) and feeding it back as input until the caption is complete.
